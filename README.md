# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Election employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.49.3

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
- The winner of the election was:
  - Candidate Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

- Calculate the voter turnout for each county
- Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- Determine the county with the highest turnout

## Challenge Summary

- The analysis shows that the counties were:
  - Jefferson
  - Denver
  - Arapahoe
 
- The county results were:
 - Jefferson contributed 10.5% of the vote and 38,855 votes
 - Denver contributed 82.8% of the vote and 306,055 votes
 - Arapahoe contributed 6.7% of the vote and 24,801 votes
 
- The largest county was:
 - Denver: Contributed 82.8% of the vote and 306,055 votes
 
- This script can be used with some modificationsâ€”for any election. For example:
 - We can alter the code to determine the county with the lowest turnout.
 - We can alter the code to further analyze more counties in Colorado or even all states in the United States.
